## CodeClub Meeting #3
#### Thursday, July 27th, 2017
##### Location: 85C Bakery Cafe - Berkeley
- 21 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

##### Attendees:
- Austin
- Craig
- Brandon
- Reuben
- Brian (organizer)

##### What did we do?
1. Discussed which programming language & frameworks would be best for a group project.
2. Brainstormed ideas for a group project
  - Craig liked the idea of doing interesting things with large data sets.
  - Reuben suggested building a blog application
  - Brian suggested a chat server + client.
  - Austin suggested meshing some sort of useful data set with the google maps api.
  - After much discussion we determined that a good initial project would be to
  build a custom message board application because it became apparent that
  whichever project we decided up on would require a lot more thought and a longer
  conversation. The message board was also agreed upon because it is a challenging,
  yet achievable, project. Not too easy, but not beyond the group's capabilities.

##### Homework
- Get up to speed with JavaScript, Node.js & Express.
  - Brian will work on getting a shell of a web application posted so the rest
  of the group can clone it and begin tinkering.
