## CodeClub Meeting #4
#### Thursday, August 3rd, 2017
##### Location: 85C Bakery Cafe - Berkeley
- 21 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

##### Attendees:
- Austin
- Brandon
- Linda
- Reed (First Time)
- Zaki (First Time)
- Brian (organizer)

##### What did we do?
1. Reed spent some time working with Linda to get her Chromebook code-ready
2. Most of us worked on getting a basic Express web app pushed to github.

##### Additional Thoughts:
What a great meetup! It was nice to meet Reed & Zaki for the first time -- both are recent transplants to the Bay Area. The group is maturing and falling into a pleasant dynamic. This week wasn't terribly structured, but people were learning and growing. Each week new faces join us -- some return, other's do not. But overall, our core group of regulars is growing.

##### Homework
- Continue learning JavaScript, Node.js & Express.
- Work on getting a basic CodeClub website built with Express.
