## CodeClub Meeting #5
#### Thursday, August 10th, 2017
##### Location: 85C Bakery Cafe - Berkeley
- 21 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

##### Attendees:
- Austin
- Linda
- Craig
- Zaki
- Amy (First Time)
- Skye (First Time)
- Brian (organizer)

##### What did we do?
1. Had two new attendees, Amy & Skye, and walked them through getting node installed.
2. Worked on getting the codeclub_website_dev repo configured properly with master & dev branches.

##### Additional Thoughts:
It was great to see the new faces. Learning node is a little slow-going, but progress is being made.
Craig brought his projector, which helped seeing his screen. I'm realizing we need to have
a written getting-started document that gets people setup on node, atom and git.

##### Homework
- Continue learning JavaScript, Node.js & Express.
- Get dev site pushed to a live heroku deployment.
- Write a getting-started document that gets people setup on node, atom and git.
