## CodeClub Meeting #6
#### Thursday, August 17th, 2017
##### Location: 85C Bakery Cafe - Berkeley
- 21 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

##### Attendees:
- Linda
- Craig
- Zaki
- Brian (organizer)

##### What did we do?
1. Successfully got website codebase to run on Heroku.
2. www.codeclub.social is now pointing to Heroku.

##### Additional Thoughts:
Zaki did a fantastic job building out the message board CRUD features. The site also looks great due to his use of bootstrap. Craig had the codebase running on Raspberry Pi, which was accessible via the local area network. Linda announced that she will not be attending CodeClub for the time being because she has been accepted into a women's coding bootcamp. Brandon also notified us remotely that, due to a scheduling conflict, he will not be able to attend for a while too.

##### Homework
- Build out the landing page and navbar.
- Implement user authentication.
- Once user authentication is working we need to look into a persistent chatroom.
