### Topics of Discussion
1. What to do with Landing Page?

2. Simple UI for meeting notes
> __[ Brian ]__ We need a simple UI for content in repo codeclub_meeting_notes.
- The purpose of these documents are to keep our meetings more productive and organized.
- Could this be incorporated into the forum?
- Why have multiple features when one will do?
- Idea: what if one feature's code handled a multitude of features, e.g.: the forum, blog, news, wiki, and meeting notes. All used the same code base, but the site used a tagging system (under the hood) to determine how items were displayed.

3. Next Project?
