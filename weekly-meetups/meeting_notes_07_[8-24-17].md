## CodeClub Meeting #7
#### Thursday, August 24th, 2017
##### Location: 85C Bakery Cafe - Berkeley
- 21 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

##### Attendees:
- Craig
- Zaki
- Baijun (First Time)
- Elliot (First Time)
- Brian (organizer)

##### What did we do?
1. Good progress was made in understanding how to implement authentication.
2. Worked out how to forward the contents of the Contact Us form to an email recipient.

##### Additional Thoughts:
Baijun and Elliot joined us for the first time, it was good to meet them both.
The group discussed the ongoing development to the website and the finer details
of the features we are working to implement. While building an internal chat and IM
system would be nice, it is not seen as a high priority and will be postponed for the time being.
JUSTIN HOFFMAN of [Code Berkeley](http://codeberkeley.com/) stopped by the table to say hi and to invite us to connect with them. Classes started this week and cover node and express. They're also putting together workshops and stuff.


##### Homework for Next Week

##### Homework Completed this Past week
